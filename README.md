# Soccer-Visualization
We will be doing some common soccer visualizations as well as trying new emerging visualization ideas.Lots of the data used for the visualization are publicly available provided by Statsbomb. Please do well to install all the needed packages and API needed to access the data. Installation instructions are provided in my Rmd files for most of the visualizations.
